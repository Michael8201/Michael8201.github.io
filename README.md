This repository hosts my professional analytics portfolio website, built using GitHub Pages.  
It includes interactive Tableau dashboards, project summaries, and data-driven insights from my work 
in Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau.

## Featured Project
**Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis (24 Months)**  
An interactive Tableau dashboard exploring rider behavior, seasonality, and membership trends to support 
data-driven marketing and operational decisions.

## Purpose
This site is designed to showcase my analytics skills, communicate insights clearly, and provide hiring 
managers with a polished, accessible view of my work.

More projects will be added as I continue developing my skills and completing new analyses.
